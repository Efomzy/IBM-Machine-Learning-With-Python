#Project Scenario

In this project, I comppleted a notebook where I build a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day.

For this project, I used a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology , clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data.

I used the following algorithms to build my models:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM
The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics, when these are applicable:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
