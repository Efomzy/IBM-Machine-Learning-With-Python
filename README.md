#Project Scenario

In this project, I completed a notebook where I built a classifier to predict whether there would be rain the following day.

For this project, I used a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms on the data.

I used the following algorithms to build my models:

1. Linear Regression
2. KNN
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. SVM
   
The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics, when these are applicable:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
